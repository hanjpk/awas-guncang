# Awas Guncang: A Mobile App for Future InaEEWS Dissemination

**Awas Guncang** is a mobile application developed as part of a research project focused on the future dissemination of the Indonesian Earthquake Early Warning System (InaEEWS). This app is designed to be a proof-of-concept for how warnings and information from InaEEWS can be effectively delivered to the public using modern mobile technologies.

This project is the implementation component of the undergraduate thesis titled: *"Design and Implementation of Awas Guncang: a Mobile App for Future Dissemination of InaEEWS"*.

## üìñ About The Project

Indonesia is located in a seismically active region, making an effective earthquake early warning system (EEWS) crucial for public safety. While Indonesia is developing its own system (InaEEWS), the dissemination of its warnings to the public remains a challenge. This project explores a potential solution by creating **Awas Guncang**, a mobile application that serves as a channel for these critical alerts.

The application is designed to:
- Receive and process earthquake raw warnings.
- Notify users based on their predicted shaking intensity.
- Provide timely and actionable information during an earthquake event.
- Serve as a robust and scalable model for the eventual nationwide rollout of InaEEWS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The application is built using a modern, cross-platform technology stack:

- [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/): The UI toolkit for building the application for both Android and iOS from a single codebase.
- [**Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging): Used as the core of the push notification system to send data messages containing warning and event information.
- [**Cloud Firestore**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore): A NoSQL database used to store user-submitted reports and feedback, as well as potentially storing event information.
